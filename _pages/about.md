I am a Data Engineer and Full stack developer currently working as an Analyst at Goldman Sachs. I build data pipelines and develop the data platform that powers the US Lending workflows at Marcus Bank, Goldman Sachs.

I completed my undergraduate in Information Science at BMS College of Engineering, graduating 3rd in my class of 2020 (CGPA: 9.6). My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. At BMSCE, I co-founded the ISE Student Club and served as the Technical Lead between 2019-2020. From a cultural standpoint, I also served as the Coordinator and Head of the Dance team.

As a research intern at Samsung Research Institute Bangalore, I served as a mentor to two undergraduate students at BMSCE where we worked to solve the problem of Named Entity Recognition in an Indian-English setting. As a result of our efforts, we were able to curate a custom NER dataset that has since been contributed towards future research in this domain.

I am an avid data enthusiast, who thoroughly enjoys writing good OOP code with as much abstraction as humanely possible. I am also a tech fanatic who enjoys a good conversation about anything electronics. Also, as a matter of fact, I have built my own PC having done all the prior research from scratch.
