I am a Data Engineer and Full stack developer currently working as an Analyst at Goldman Sachs. I build data pipelines and develop the data platform that powers the US Lending workflows at Marcus Bank, Goldman Sachs.

I am an avid data enthusiast, who thoroughly enjoys writing good OOP code with as much abstraction as humanely possible.
