I am a <b>Data Engineer</b> and <b>Full stack developer</b> currently working as an Analyst at <b><a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a></b>. I build data pipelines and develop the data platform that powers the US Lending workflows at <b><a href="https://www.marcus.com/us/en" target="_blank">Marcus Bank</a></b>, Goldman Sachs

I completed my undergraduate in  <b>Information Science</b> at <b><a href="https://www.bmsce.ac.in/" target="_blank">BMS College of Engineering</a></b>, graduating 3rd in my class of 2020 <b><i>(CGPA: 9.6)</i></b>. My research interests include Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. At BMSCE, I co-founded the <b>ISE Student Club</b> and served as the <b>Technical Lead</b> between 2019-2020. From a cultural standpoint, I also served as the <b>Coordinator and Head</b> of the College Dance team.

As a research intern at <b><a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b" target="_blank">Samsung Research Institute Bangalore</a></b>, I served as a <b>mentor</b> to two undergraduate students at BMSCE where we worked to solve the problem of <b>Named Entity Recognition</b> in an Indian-English setting. As a result of our efforts, we were able to curate a custom NER dataset that has since been contributed towards future research in this domain.

I am an avid data enthusiast, who thoroughly enjoys writing good OOP code with as much abstraction as humanely possible. I am also a tech fanatic who enjoys a good conversation about anything electronics. Also, as a matter of fact, I have built my own PC having done all the prior research from scratch.
