Program that performs named entity and category recognition on English sentences. We provide a User Interface that takes sentences as input. We developed 2 models that independently perform both tasks simultaneously on the input from the UI.

- Named Entities are colored by the corresponding tags that they belong
- Categories are displayed at the bottom in Black
